# Tic-Tac-Toe Robot

A two-board ESP32 system that plays tic-tac-toe against a human. The robot draws **X** with a pen plotter; the human draws **O** by hand. Both boards coordinate through a Python server over WiFi — there is no direct wiring between them.

---

## Hardware

| Board | Role |
|---|---|
| AI Thinker ESP32-CAM | Captures images, detects the human's move via the Python server |
| Seeed XIAO ESP32-C3 | Drives X/Y steppers and the pen servo; polls the server for the next move |

**Power:** The motor board should be powered from a battery (or a beefy external supply), **not** from laptop USB. Drawing strokes pull enough current to brown out a laptop-powered board, which causes the pen to tap instead of drawing.

**No inter-board wiring.** Each board talks only to the Python server over WiFi.

## Software

| File | Runs on |
|---|---|
| `camera_code/camera_code.ino` | Camera board (AI Thinker ESP32-CAM) |
| `stepper_code/stepper_code.ino` | Motor board (XIAO ESP32-C3) |
| `detect.py` | Laptop (Python Flask server, port 6000) |

---

## Setup

### 1. Laptop

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python detect.py
```

The server binds `0.0.0.0:6000`. Note the laptop's LAN IP — if it isn't `192.168.0.160`, update the three URL constants in both `camera_code/camera_code.ino` and `stepper_code/stepper_code.ino`.

### 2. Motor board (XIAO ESP32-C3)

- Install libraries: **AccelStepper** and **ESP32Servo**.
- Open `stepper_code/stepper_code.ino`.
- Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino → **XIAO_ESP32C3**.
- Flash.
- Open the USB serial monitor. Jog the plotter with `XR`/`XL`/`YU`/`YD` to your desired home position, then type `H` to set origin.

### 3. Camera board (AI Thinker ESP32-CAM)

- Install the **esp32 by Espressif Systems** board package (provides `esp_camera.h`).
- Open `camera_code/camera_code.ino`.
- Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino → **AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**.
- Tools → Partition Scheme → **Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)**.
- Flash with **IO0 pulled to GND** during upload (release after).

### 4. WiFi

Both boards connect to `MAKERSPACE` (password `12345678`) on boot. Update the credentials in both sketches if your network differs.

## Gameplay

1. Make sure `detect.py` is running on the laptop.
2. Power on both boards. They connect to WiFi and idle — the motor polls `/get-move` every 2 seconds, the camera waits for `start`.
3. On the camera board's serial monitor, type **`start`**. This:
   - resets the Python server's game state,
   - signals the motor to re-home and redraw a fresh grid on paper,
   - waits for the motor to confirm ready, then
   - begins scanning the board every 10 seconds.
4. Draw an **O** by hand in any empty cell.
5. Within ~10 seconds the camera will scan, the server will validate your move, compute the robot's **X**, and the motor will draw it.
6. Repeat until someone wins or the board fills.

## Communication Architecture

No wires between the boards — everything goes through the laptop.

## HTTP API

All endpoints live on `http://<laptop-ip>:6000`. The boards talk only to the Python server, never to each other.

### `POST /detect`

Called by the camera board every ~10 s while a game is active.

- **Request:** raw JPEG bytes, `Content-Type: image/jpeg`
- **Response 200:** `{"board": [[".", "O", "."], [".", "X", "."], [".", ".", "."]], "move": N}` — `move` is the 1-indexed cell chosen for X, or `null` if the frame didn't update game state
- **Errors:** `400` no image data / decode failure; `404` grid not found in image

A move is only accepted if exactly one new O was placed in a previously empty cell and no existing mark changed. Invalid frames are ignored and the previous `move` is returned.

### `GET /get-move`

Polled by the motor board every 2 s.

- **Response 200:** `{"move": N}`
  - `-1` — reset signal (re-home, redraw grid, then `POST /ready`). Served once, then cleared.
  - `0` — idle, no pending move
  - `1`–`9` — draw X in that cell

### `POST /reset`

Called by the camera board when the user types `start`. Clears game state and queues `move=-1` for the motor board's next poll.

- **Request:** `{}` · **Response:** `{"status": "ok"}`

### `POST /ready`

Called by the motor board after it finishes re-homing and drawing the grid.

- **Request:** `{}` · **Response:** `{"status": "ok"}`

### `GET /ready`

Polled by the camera board (every 3 s, up to 2 min) while it waits for the grid to be drawn.

- **Response 200:** `{"ready": true}` or `{"ready": false}`

1 | 2 | 3
4 | 5 | 6
7 | 8 | 9
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Pen taps up and down instead of drawing strokes | Power brownout. Run the motor board from a battery instead of laptop USB. |
| `esp_camera.h: No such file` on the camera board | Install the Espressif ESP32 board package in Arduino IDE. |
| Camera board won't connect to WiFi | Check SSID/password in `camera_code/camera_code.ino`. The camera prints WiFi status on its USB serial monitor at boot. |
| Detection returns garbage | Check lighting and the camera's view of the full grid. Inspect `latest.jpg`, `debug_grid.jpg`, and `images/cell_r*_c*.jpg` after a scan. |
